        <h2>THE COST OF TRADE IS HIGH</h2>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-icon-header-main.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>A country's "cost of trade" is a broad measure that relates the cost of goods in cross border trade to the cost of the same goods in domestic trade. UNCTAD and the World Bank have developed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unescap.org/resources/escap-world-bank-trade-cost-database">country level database</a> and some helpful <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/01-ESCAP-WB%20Trade%20Cost%20database-Yann%20Duval.pdf">explanatory material</a>.</p>

        <p>The global average cost of trade is about 100% for manufactured goods and over 150% for agricultural goods. Less than 10% of that is duty. Around 45% is distributor mark up and about 20% is actual shipping costs. The remaining 25% or so is non-tarriff border costs, part of which is traceable to complex paper based cross-border processes which are imposing a handbrake on the global economy of at least <strong>1 trillion dollars</strong> annually.</p>

        <p>Although many countries have achieved a high degree of digitisation at a national level through initiatives such as trade single windows, most cross-border processes are still paper based. Thats because there's no direct trust relationship between an issuer of a paper document in the exporting country and the customs authority in the importing country.</p>

          <p>The UN/CEFACT <a target="_blank" href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/Cross+border+Inter-ledger+exchange+for+Preferential+CoO+using+Blockchain">inter-customs ledger (ICL) protocol</a> is desinged to digitise all cross-border paperwork. ICL is essentially a high integrity trust proxy - the importing regulator trusts the digital document because the exportiung regulator has verified it. The ICL leverages distributed ledger technology (eg blockchain) in order to assure the integrity of the network and also to avoid the need for any shared infrastructure. Each country hosts it's documents in it's own secure repository and shares them with other countries via the ledger</p>

        <h3 class="brand-light-text">AN EXAMPLE - CERTIFICATES OF ORIGIN</h3>
        <p>This document is used to prove the origin of business, trying to import or export goods. Currently it’s a paper certificate that changes hands <strong>at least 6 times</strong> in support of one consignment.</p>

      <div class="col-md-5 mb-45">
        <p>But, using ICL, a digital certificate of origin is forwarded directly to the importing regulator and a near real time acknowledgement gives the exporter confidence that the regulator has accepted the certificate validity.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-implementation-icon.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Implementation Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>China, Australia, Singapore and India are already currently collaborating with the UN to develop the Inter Customs Ledger > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/">https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/</a> </p>

        <p>Since the UN project launch in March 2019 in Geneva, delegates from multiple countries have joined  the project’s team. You can follow the project’s activity here > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/icl/">https://edi3.org/icl/</a> </p>

        <p>For the full and effective implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger, we need to the worldwide collaboration, which is why we would like to invite your government to join the ICL project.</p>

        <p>The Australian Border Force developed Tradebridge, the first software implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger.</p>

        <p>To advance collaboration, the Australian Government has made TradeBridge’s software Open Source Software. It’s freely available at Github > <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trustbridge">https://github.com/trustbridge</a> .</p>

        <h4>WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOUR GOVERNMENT TO USE OR IMPROVE TRADEBRIDGE’S OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.</h4>
