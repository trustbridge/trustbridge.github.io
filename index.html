        <h2>THE COST OF TRADE IS HIGH</h2>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-icon-header-main.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>A country's "cost of trade" is a broad measure that relates the cost of goods in cross border trade to the cost of the same goods in domestic trade. UNCTAD and the World Bank have developed a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unescap.org/resources/escap-world-bank-trade-cost-database">country level database</a> and some helpful <a target="_blank" href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/01-ESCAP-WB%20Trade%20Cost%20database-Yann%20Duval.pdf">explanatory material</a>.</p>

        <p>The global average cost of trade is about 100% for manufactured goods and over 150% for agricultural goods. Less than 10% of that is duty. Around 45% is distributor mark up and about 20% is actual shipping costs. The remaining 25% or so is non-tarriff border costs, part of which is traceable to complex paper based cross-border processes which are imposing a handbrake on the global economy of at least <strong>1 trillion dollars</strong> annually.</p>

        <p>Although many countries have achieved a high degree of digitisation at a national level through initiatives such as trade single windows, most cross-border processes are still paper based. Thats because there's no direct trust relationship between an issuer of a paper document in the exporting country and the customs authority in the importing country.</p>

          <h2>SOLUTION: INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER </h2>
  
          <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-solution-icon.png" alt="Trust Bridge Solution Icon" class="img-50">
  
          <p>The UN/CEFACT <p><a target="_blank" href="https://uncefact.unece.org/display/uncefactpublic/Cross+border+Inter-ledger+exchange+for+Preferential+CoO+using+Blockchain">inter-customs ledger (ICL) protocol</a> is desinged to digitise all cross-border paperwork. ICL is essentially a high integrity trust proxy - the importing regulator trusts the digital document because the exportiung regulator has verified it. The ICL leverages distributed ledger technology (eg blockchain) in order to assure the integrity of the network and also to avoid the need for any shared infrastructure. Each country hosts it's documents in it's own secure repository and shares them with other countries via the ledger</p>

          <h3 class="brand-dark-text">WHAT IS THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER (ICL)?</h3>

          <p>The UN’s Inter Customs Ledger (ICL) is the first digital platform that empowers every government to safely digitise, control and verify their own trade documentation. It also enables each country to securely control the selective sharing of information necessary for cross-border administration.</p>

          <p>The ICL is decentralised platform. It supports the full independence of every country, while offering the option of safely sharing pieces of verified information, derived of any sensitive trade data, across national borders.</p>

          <h3>HOW DOES THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER ENSURE SECURITY AND AUTONOMY?</h3>
          
          <p>The Inter Customs Ledger is power by the Blockchain technology, one of the most secure technologies in the world.</p>

          <p>Blockchain makes it possible to digitise and safeguard local trade documents – without the risk of fraud, alterations or manual errors. It also enables government to safely share very specific digital information cross-borders without risking the exploitation of other sensitive trade information.</p>

          <h4>THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER (ICL) CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE INDEPENDENT DIGITISED SYSTEM AND GLOBAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION FASTER, MORE SECURE AND NOTABLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE.</h4>

          <br><br>

          <h3>HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WORK AND WHY IS IT SO SECURE?</h3>

          <p>Blockchain technology works by watermarking documents with code sequences that cannot be altered without notice.</p>

          <p>When a copy is made it assumes a new code that relates to the original, but you can always trace the exact history of any document or any copy digitally. It’s impossible to create a copy that takes on the code of the original.</p>

          <p>This is how the ICL can ensure that documents are authentic. Every document has a clear and unchangeable digital history.</p>

          <p>This is also what makes it possible to share selective information on a Ledger. The copied information, although derived of any sensitive data, still bears an indisputable connection to the original.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-implementation-icon.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Implementation Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>China, Australia, Singapore and India are already currently collaborating with the UN to develop the Inter Customs Ledger > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/">https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/</a> </p>

        <p>Since the UN project launch in March 2019 in Geneva, delegates from multiple countries have joined  the project’s team. You can follow the project’s activity here > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/icl/">https://edi3.org/icl/</a> </p>

        <p>For the full and effective implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger, we need to the worldwide collaboration, which is why we would like to invite your government to join the ICL project.</p>

        <p>The Australian Border Force developed Tradebridge, the first software implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger.</p>

        <p>To advance collaboration, the Australian Government has made TradeBridge’s software Open Source Software. It’s freely available at Github > <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trustbridge">https://github.com/trustbridge</a> .</p>

        <h4>WE WOULD LIKE TO INVITE YOUR GOVERNMENT TO USE OR IMPROVE TRADEBRIDGE’S OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE.</h4>
