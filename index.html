        <h2>THE PROBLEM WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE DOCUMENTATION</h2>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-icon-header-main.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>Despite the number of governments who have digitised their local import or export administration, paper-based trade administration is costing governments at least 1 trillion dollars every year <strong>(Internal Powerpoint reference)</strong>.</p>

        <p>Some countries like Australia are 99% paperless, however the international administration between different countries, is still largely paper-based <strong> (Single Page Powerpoint reference)</strong>.</p>

        </video>

        <p>Paper is naturally vulnerable to fraud and manual errors, so multiple check is vital with a paper-based system. However this makes the process costly, slow and probe to hold-ups.</p>

        <p>Every government uses an independent administration system to issue documentation between local exporters or importers and the its Border Control. Consequently there isn’t one globally trusted platform that can streamline cross-border administration. Paperwork is simply the default to reconcile the validity of various documents from various regulators.</p>
      
        <p>As every country uses a different independent system, there’s no single platform that every country trusts to authenticate documentation across the board.</p>
      
        <p>That’s why a single documents changes multiple hands, and authorities for various authentications, to ensure its validity across borders.</p>

        <p>The current administrative system not only causes excessive red-tape and lengthy timeframes, but it also creates red-tape barriers that inhibits exporting businesses  from trade (single page reference).</p>
        <h4>WHY ISN’T THE SYSTEM DIGITISED YET?</h4>
        <p>Up to quite recently, there hasn’t been a digital system that would safeguard the autonomy of every country’s trade system, while also facilitating the secure digital administration between countries.</p>

          <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-solution-icon.png" alt="Trust Bridge Solution Icon" class="img-50">
  
          <p>It’s possible to eliminate paperwork by designing a shared and secure digital platform that safeguards the autonomy of every country and simultaneously builds trusted digital bridges between countries and their trade documentation.</p>
  
          <h4>THAT WHY UN’S CEFACT DEVELOPED THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER; IT’S A SECURE DIGITAL SOLUTION FOR IMPROVED CROSS-BORDER TRADE ADMINISTRATION.</h4>
  
          <p><a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/icl/">CEFACT</a> is a unit of the UN responsible for international trade standards.</p>

          <h3 class="brand-dark-text">WHAT IS THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER (ICL)?</h3>

          <p>The UN’s Inter Customs Ledger (ICL) is the first digital platform that empowers every government to safely digitise, control and verify their own trade documentation. It also enables each country to securely control the selective sharing of information necessary for cross-border administration.</p>

          <p>The ICL is decentralised platform. It supports the full independence of every country, while offering the option of safely sharing pieces of verified information, derived of any sensitive trade data, across national borders.</p>

          <p><strong>The UN Project, on the Inter Customs Ledger, is publicly available here > </strong> <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/">https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/</a></p>
  
          <h3 class="brand-dark-text">HOW DOES THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER WORK?</h3>

          <p>This cross-border Ledger is unique, because it relies on each country’s Department of Home Affairs to issue guaranteed digital authentications of all its local importers, exporters and their trade documentation.</p>

          <p>The Inter Customs Ledger enables your local Department’s to create a log of verified authentications. This log is simply lists verifications, derived of any other detailed, sensitive data.</p>

          <p>When the Customs from another country needs a specific document, your local Customs offers simply grants them permission to view the applicable log. Importers, exporters and port authorities can get their relevant documents directly and digitally from the Department of Home Affairs.</p>

          <p>There’s no need for an extensive chain of paper-based authentications by different authorities. The verification is shared between two trusted authorities, because its government to government. It’s direct, it’s trustworthy and it offers real-time verifications.</p>

          <h3>HOW DOES THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER ENSURE SECURITY AND AUTONOMY?</h3>
          
          <p>The Inter Customs Ledger is power by the Blockchain technology, one of the most secure technologies in the world.</p>

          <p>Blockchain makes it possible to digitise and safeguard local trade documents – without the risk of fraud, alterations or manual errors. It also enables government to safely share very specific digital information cross-borders without risking the exploitation of other sensitive trade information.</p>

          <h4>THE INTER CUSTOMS LEDGER (ICL) CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE INDEPENDENT DIGITISED SYSTEM AND GLOBAL TRADE ADMINISTRATION FASTER, MORE SECURE AND NOTABLY MORE COST-EFFECTIVE.</h4>

          <br><br>

          <h3>HOW DOES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY WORK AND WHY IS IT SO SECURE?</h3>

          <p>Blockchain technology works by watermarking documents with code sequences that cannot be altered without notice.</p>

          <p>When a copy is made it assumes a new code that relates to the original, but you can always trace the exact history of any document or any copy digitally. It’s impossible to create a copy that takes on the code of the original.</p>

          <p>This is how the ICL can ensure that documents are authentic. Every document has a clear and unchangeable digital history.</p>

          <p>This is also what makes it possible to share selective information on a Ledger. The copied information, although derived of any sensitive data, still bears an indisputable connection to the original.</p>

        <img src="/assets/img/trust-bridge-implementation-icon.png" alt="Trust Bridge System Implementation Illustration" class="img-50 mb-20">

        <p>China, Australia, Singapore and India are already currently collaborating with the UN to develop the Inter Customs Ledger > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/">https://edi3.org/specs/edi3-icl/master/</a> </p>

        <p>Since the UN project launch in March 2019 in Geneva, delegates from multiple countries have joined  the project’s team. You can follow the project’s activity here > <a target="_blank" href="https://edi3.org/icl/">https://edi3.org/icl/</a> </p>

        <p>For the full and effective implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger, we need to the worldwide collaboration, which is why we would like to invite your government to join the ICL project.</p>

        <p>The Australian Border Force developed Tradebridge, the first software implementation of the Inter Customs Ledger.</p>

        <p>To advance collaboration, the Australian Government has made TradeBridge’s software Open Source Software. It’s freely available at Github > <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/trustbridge">https://github.com/trustbridge</a> .</p>
